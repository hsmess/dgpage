# Layout and the Course

## Layout for both rounds: Modified Blue Layout

The exact layout will be published in the next few days, but most of the holes will be the traditional "blue" layout at Cotswold View, with some changes including adding one temp hole in order to facilitate changes to the "ride" holes (9, 10, 11) to help with speed of play. Additionally, a couple of other holes' White tees will be played.
