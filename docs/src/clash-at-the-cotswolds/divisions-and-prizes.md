# Divisions and Prizes

## Available Divisions

We have decided to run the following divisions.

**PRO**: MPO, FPO

**AM**: FA2, MA2, MA3, MA4, Juniors

Please note, Masters players should register for whichever amatuer or pro division their rating suggests. With the proximity in dates to the Masters, we have decided not to run the age protected divisions.
